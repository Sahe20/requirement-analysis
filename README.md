This repo would cover my requirement analysis for my airbnb project with ALx. 

📌 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a foundational phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where stakeholders, business analysts, and developers collaborate to understand what a software system must do. It involves identifying, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of end-users and stakeholders for a proposed system.

The goal of this phase is to clearly define what the system should do (functional requirements) and how well it should do it (non-functional requirements), laying a clear foundation for system design, development, and testing.

Requirement Analysis helps bridge the communication gap between non-technical stakeholders and technical teams, ensuring that the end product aligns with the business needs and user expectations.

💡 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC for several key reasons:

Avoids Miscommunication and Errors

It ensures that developers, clients, and stakeholders are on the same page, reducing the risk of building the wrong system or missing important features.

Improves Project Planning

Well-defined requirements provide a solid basis for time, cost, and resource estimation, allowing better project scheduling and risk management.

Facilitates High-Quality Software Development

When requirements are clear, validated, and understood, the chances of delivering a functional and bug-free product increase significantly.

⚙️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The Requirement Analysis phase typically involves the following five key activities:

🔍 Requirement Gathering

Collecting initial requirements from all stakeholders using interviews, questionnaires, workshops, etc.

🗣️ Requirement Elicitation

Engaging stakeholders actively to draw out hidden, implied, or unstated needs that may not be easily documented.

📝 Requirement Documentation

Recording requirements in a structured and clear format, like Software Requirements Specification (SRS), user stories, or use cases.

📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling

Analyzing the relationships, constraints, and feasibility of requirements, often visualized through models such as flowcharts, data flow diagrams, or UML.

✅ Requirement Validation

Verifying that requirements are complete, consistent, feasible, and aligned with business goals before development begins.

📚 Types of Requirements
✅ Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define what the system should do. These are the specific behaviors or functions of the system and describe interactions between the system and its users.

Examples for Booking Management System:

Users can search for available rooms or services.

Users can make a booking for a specific date and time.

Admins can approve or cancel bookings.

The system sends a confirmation email after a successful booking.

Users can view and edit their booking history.

⚙️ Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define how the system performs its functions. These are constraints or quality attributes such as performance, usability, reliability, etc.

Examples for Booking Management System:

The system should load booking search results within 2 seconds.

The application must be available 99.9% of the time.

Only authorized users should be able to access booking data.

The system should support up to 1,000 concurrent users.

🎯 Use Case Diagrams
What are Use Case Diagrams?
Use Case Diagrams are visual representations of user interactions (called actors) and the system. They show the various actions (use cases) each actor can perform and help stakeholders understand the system's behavior at a glance.

Benefits:

Clarify system scope and user interactions

Help identify functional requirements early

Foster communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders

Booking System – Use Case Diagram
Actors:

User

Admin

Use Cases:

Search for rooms

Book a room

View booking history

Cancel booking

Approve/decline booking

Manage availability

The UI must be responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.
