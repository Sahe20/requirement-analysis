This repo would cover my requirement analysis for my airbnb project with ALx. 

ðŸ“Œ What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a foundational phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where stakeholders, business analysts, and developers collaborate to understand what a software system must do. It involves identifying, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of end-users and stakeholders for a proposed system.

The goal of this phase is to clearly define what the system should do (functional requirements) and how well it should do it (non-functional requirements), laying a clear foundation for system design, development, and testing.

Requirement Analysis helps bridge the communication gap between non-technical stakeholders and technical teams, ensuring that the end product aligns with the business needs and user expectations.
